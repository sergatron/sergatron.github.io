# DATA SCIENCE PROJECTS

### DISASTER RESPONSE - [Project Link](HTTPS://GITHUB.COM/SERGATRON/DISASTER-RESPONSE-PROJECT)
#### NOV 2019
- Utilized frameworks such as NLTK and Scikit-Learn to perform ETL, build ML pipeline, and deploy ML model to a local web application. 
- The ML pipeline processes 26,000 raw text messages using NLTK and Scikit-Learn to build a multioutput classification model. 
- Maximized F1 score through feature engineering and parameter tuning.

### SOLAR ARRAY COST PREDICTION - [Project Link](https://github.com/sergatron/projects/tree/master/solar_array)
#### JULY 2019
- Analysis revealed a trend of declining national average installation costs of about 30% since 2009 peak.
- Predicted the cost of a residential solar panel array using a ML pipeline built using Scikit-Learn. 
- Evaluated multiple regression models (Ridge, RandomForest, GradientBoosting) and optimized the pipeline to minimize the RMSE and MAE.
